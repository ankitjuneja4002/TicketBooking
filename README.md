🎟️ Ticket Booking System (Command-Line Application)

This project is a Java-based Ticket Booking System built as a command-line application, with the goal of strengthening my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and applying them to a real-world problem.
The system simulates core railway booking functionalities such as user authentication, train discovery, seat reservation and booking cancellation in a structured and modular way.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in designing scalable logic, managing application state and structuring a clean Java codebase.

🚀 Features

User Authentication
Secure user registration and login flow.

Train Search
Search available trains based on source and destination stations.

Seat Availability Check
View seat availability before confirming a booking.

Ticket Booking & Cancellation
Reserve seats and cancel existing bookings with proper validation.

Data Persistence
User and booking information is stored and managed during runtime.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Java – Core language for application logic

Gradle – Build automation and dependency management

Java Collections & Streams API – Efficient in-memory data handling

OOP Principles – Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

📦 Setup & Execution
Step 1: Clone the Repository

Step 2: Build the Project
./gradlew build

Step 3: Run the Application
./gradlew run

📌 Usage Flow

1️⃣ Create a new user account (Sign Up)
2️⃣ Log in using registered credentials
3️⃣ Search for trains by entering source and destination
4️⃣ Check seat availability
5️⃣ Book a seat and confirm the reservation
6️⃣ Cancel an existing booking if required
7️⃣ Exit the application

🏗️ Future Improvements

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Enhance usability with a desktop or web-based interface.

Database Integration
Persist user, train, and booking data using a relational database.

Admin Module
Allow administrators to manage train schedules, seat allocation, and bookings.
